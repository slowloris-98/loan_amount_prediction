# Loan Disbursement Prediction Project

Loans are a vital factor in economic development as they allow businesses and individuals to grow and boost the economy. They enable business expansion, innovation initiatives, real estate development, job creation, and liquidity in financial markets.

The challenge in the loan disbursement system lies in calculating the right amount of money to be disbursed. If lenders are too lenient, it can lead to an economic crisis, such as the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007-08. On the other hand, overly stringent lending practices can restrain economic growth by hindering the development of businesses and individuals.

This project aims to predict the right amount of loan for an applicant based on various factors such as demographics, purpose, market demands, income, and other features. For this purpose, we are utilizing the **BigQuery Fintech Dataset** from Kaggle [1], which includes tables containing customer information, previous years' loan disbursement details, regional data, and other relevant information.
